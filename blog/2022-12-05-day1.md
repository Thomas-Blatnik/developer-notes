- What I learned today?
- What do you remember that you *think* is important.
    - What is the CLR?
        The CLR (Common Language Runtime) is a virtual machine that converts code written in .NET to IL code and executes it.
    - What is IL code?
        IL (Intermediate Language) code is the code that is created when code written in .NET is compiled. The IL code is then compiled into machine code
    - What is the entry point for a .net application?
        The entry point for a .net application where the code starts executing when the application is run.
    - What is ".Net Core" and why was it important?
        .NET Core was created as a cross-platform version of .NET Framework which only could run on Windows. As of .NET6, .NET Framework and .NET Core
        are merged and is just referred to as .NET.
