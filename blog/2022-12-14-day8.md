- Redux
    - Allows you to keep track of the state of the application (what things are right now)
    - State
        - Actions
            - Dispatch actions - every interaction is an action
            - Example code:
```ts
import { createActionGroup, emptyProps, props } from "@ngrx/store";

 

export const CounterCommands = createActionGroup({
    source: 'Counter Commands',
    events: {
        incremented: emptyProps(),
        decremented: emptyProps(),
        reset: emptyProps(),
        countby: props<{by: 1 | 3 | 5}>()
    }
})
```

        - Reducers
            - functions to change the state of the application
            - Example code:

```ts
import { createReducer, on } from "@ngrx/store";
import { CounterCommands } from "../actions/count-actions";

export interface CountState {
    current: number;
    by: 1 | 3 | 5;
}

const initialState:CountState = {
    current: 0,
    by: 1
}
export const reducer = createReducer(initialState,
    on(CounterCommands.countby, (s,a) => ({...s, by: a.by})),
    on(CounterCommands.reset, (s) => ({...s, current: 0})),
    on(CounterCommands.incremented, (currentState) => ({...currentState, current: currentState.current + currentState.by})),
    on(CounterCommands.decremented, (s) => ({...s, current: s.current - s.by}))
);
```
